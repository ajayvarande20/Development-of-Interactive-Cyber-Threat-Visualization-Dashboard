        "## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc., in programming.\n",
        "\n",
        "Python is a multi-paradigm language and fully supports OOP.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Concepts of OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Class**: A blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
        "2.  **Object**: An instance of a class. It's a concrete entity created from a class.\n",
        "3.  **Attributes**: Variables that belong to an object. They represent the state or characteristics of an object.\n",
        "4.  **Methods**: Functions that belong to an object. They represent the behavior or actions that an object can perform.\n",
        "5.  **Encapsulation**: The bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which can prevent accidental modification of data. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through naming conventions (e.g., `_attribute` for protected, `__attribute` for private).\n",
        "6.  **Inheritance**: A mechanism that allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass/base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a 'is-a' relationship.\n",
        "7.  **Polymorphism**: The ability of an object to take on many forms. In OOP, it allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. In Python, this is often achieved through method overriding and duck typing.\n",
        "8.  **Abstraction**: The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. In Python, abstract classes and methods (using the `abc` module) are used to achieve abstraction."

        "## NumPy Library in Python\n",
        "\n",
        "**NumPy** (Numerical Python) is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is NumPy important?\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Performance**: NumPy's core is written in C and Fortran, making it significantly faster than standard Python lists for numerical operations on large datasets.\n",
        "2.  **Powerful N-dimensional Array Object (`ndarray`)**: This is the most important object in NumPy. It's a homogeneous container for data (all elements must be of the same type) and is designed for efficient storage and manipulation of numerical data.\n",
        "3.  **Broadcasting**: NumPy's broadcasting feature allows operations between arrays of different shapes, simplifying code and improving performance.\n",
        "4.  **Mathematical Functions**: It offers a vast collection of mathematical functions to operate on arrays, including linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, random number generation, and more.\n",
        "5.  **Foundation for Other Libraries**: Many other scientific computing libraries in Python, such as Pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib, are built on top of NumPy.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Core Concept: The `ndarray` Object\n",
        "\n",
        "A NumPy `ndarray` is a grid of values, all of the same type, and is indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. The number of dimensions is the `rank` of the array; the `shape` of an array is a tuple of integers giving the size of the array along each dimension.\n"
